# bikers_without_helmet
A python software to detect the number plate of bikers without helmet
1. Detect people who are driving a motorcycle: To implement this we will use <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/savanagrawal/detect-person-on-motorbike-or-scooter">dataset</a> from kaggle which contains 795 images of people driving various types of motor cycles, taken from various directions, distances.
2. Detect whether driver is wearing a helmet or not: To implement this we will use the <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/bike-helmets/bike-helmet-detection-2vdjo/dataset/1">bike-helmet-detection-2vdjo</a> dataset from roboflow which contains nearly 1376 images of people with and without helmet.
3. Detect the license plate and extract the registration number: To implement license plate detection we will use <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/vehicle-registration-plates-trudk/dataset/1">vehicle-registration-plates-trudk</a> dataset from roboflow which contains 8823 images of Vehicle Registration plates captured in various situations, locations, environmental conditions. Extracting the number from number plate image can be done by using Tesseract-OCR.
